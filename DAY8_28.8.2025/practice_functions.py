"""ðŸ“Œ Day 8 Task: Transaction Logger
Create a simple Python program that:

Starts with a variable balance = 1000.
Uses a loop to let the user add or subtract money.
Input "deposit" â†’ ask how much to add.
Input "withdraw" â†’ ask how much to subtract.
Input "exit" â†’ stop the program.
Every time a transaction happens, store it in a list of strings like:
