"""
ðŸ‘‰ Task Manager (OOP + JSON)
This project is a simple command-line Task Manager application.

Features:
- Add new tasks with a title and optional description
- View all saved tasks
- Remove tasks by their ID
- Persistent storage using a JSON file (tasks are saved between runs)

Learning Goals:
- Practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Python classes
- Understand how JSON works for structured data storage
- Learn how to separate logic into multiple files (modular design)
- Build a real-world CLI tool that goes beyond text file storage """
